                    <h1>Grandiosity</h1>
                    <p>U.P. being the largest state of India with an area of around two lacs forty 
                        thousand square kilometers and population of more than 165 million people makes 
                        AKTU as one of the largest technical universities not only in India but perhaps 
                        in Asia. Because of its gigantic size and number of colleges affiliated to it and 
                        geographic dispersion, it has been sub-divided into five zones with 150-160 colleges 
                        in each zone for the ease of management and facilitating inter-zonal comparison and 
                        possible internal competition to enhance quality of teaching-learning processes.</p>
                        
                        <p>AKTU envisions to facilitate and nurture the quality of technical education 
                            and research in its own premises as well as all affiliating institutions. 
                            The total number of affiliated colleges was 49 in the year 2000 which has 
                            now gone up to 756 and the University is still growing. The University 
                            Conducts State level Entrance Examination U.P.S.E.E. for admission to 
                            various programs in institutions affiliated to AKTU and some Universities of 
                            U.P.. The University conducts central examinations in each semester for all 
                            the affiliated colleges and institutions and declares results quickly using 
                            technology-enabled systems. At present around 4,00,000 students are enrolled 
                            in its various programmes.</p>
